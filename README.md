# OpenLayers + Proj4rs with Vite

This example demonstrates how `OpenLayers` can be used with `Proj4rs`. It is based on `OpenLayers` + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

To get started, run the following (requires Node 14+):

```bash
npm update
npm start
```

Then go to http://localhost:5173 with your browser, you must have a development server started.

To generate a build ready for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then deploy the contents of the `dist` directory to your server.
You can also run `npm run serve` to serve the results of the `dist` directory for preview.
